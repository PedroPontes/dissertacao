%\textit{In this chapter the experimental setups used will be shown and explained in detail.}

% \section{Introduction}

% The experimental setups used in this work had two main themes: droplets on heated surfaces and pool boiling. In the Droplets Experiments a vertical and horizontal view were considered, but in the boiling experiments, because of the water opacity to IR radiation, only the vertical experiment was made.
